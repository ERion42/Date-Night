# DateNite Application (Working Title)
## Description
Do you have a date but don't feel particularly creative? Are you just really bad at planning dates and choosing activities? Use DateNite! 

Using a series of intuitive questions, this app will set out an itinerary for a nice little date! This will pick movies, dinner, and activities so you don't have to worry about any of those pesky details and can just enjoy your excursion. If nothing else, if the date goes poorly you can always blame the application (and its developers!) 
The following is a link to the website.  Your personalized date begins now.  <a src="https://erion42.github.io/groupProject/index.html%22%3EClick Here</a>
